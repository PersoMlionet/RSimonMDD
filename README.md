In order to view my project follow the steps below

1. First take the gestureArt folder and place that into your htdocs.
2. Create a new database called ci_user.
3. Next take the sequel file attached within the final folder and import that into your new ci_user database within the window query section.
4. Next Start MAMP.
5. Next open your selected web browser and navigate to 'localhost:8888/gestureArt/' in your browser.
6. You will need to use localhost:8888 because my javascript files are setup to use localhost:8888 along with other files.
